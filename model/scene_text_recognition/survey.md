### 2020
- [AAAI2020] [Decoupled Attention Network for Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10205)
  - **short summary**
    - narrow advantage
  - annotation
    - word level
  - rectification module
    - todo
  - feature map
    - 2d
  - decoder
    - RNN
  - motivation
    - there is misalignment between the ground truth strings and the attention’s output sequences of probability distribution, which is caused by missing or superfluous characters
  - solution & novelty
    - decouples the alignment operation from using historical decoding results
    - alignment is achived by a spatial attention module
  - the devil in the details
    - None
### 2019
- [CVPR2019] [Aggregation Cross-Entropy for Sequence Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08364)
  - **short summary**
    - unfair comparison
    - interesting idea
  - annotation
    - characters and their count in the sequence annotation  
  - rectification module
    - todo
  - feature map
    - 2d
  - decoder
    - ACE
  - motivation
    - CTC and RNN based mechanism is not easy enough
  - solution & novelty
    - proposes the ACE loss function
      - much quicker implementation, faster inference/back-propagation, approximately O(1) in parallel
      - less storage requirement (no parameter and negligible runtime memory)
      - convenient employment (by replacing CTC with ACE)
      - competitive performance to CTC and the attention mechanism
  - the devil in the details
    - None  
### 2018
- [CVPR2018] [Edit Probability for Scene Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03384)
  - short summary
    - todo
  - annotation
    - word level
  - rectification module
    - todo
  - feature map
    - 1d
  - decoder
    - RNN and attention
  - motivation
    - there is misalignment between the ground truth strings and the attention’s output sequences of probability distribution, which is caused by missing or superfluous characters
  - solution & novelty
    - propose a novel method called edit probability (EP) for scene text recognition
    - EP tries to effectively estimate the probability of generating a string from the output sequence of probability distribution conditioned on the input image, while considering the possible occurrences of missing/superfluous characters
    - the advantage lies in that the training process can focus on the missing, superfluous and unrecognized characters, and thus the impact of the misalignment problem can be alleviated or even overcome

    - None 
- [CVPR2018] [AON: Towards Arbitrarily-Oriented Text Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04226)
  - **short summary**
    - good performace on irregular dataset
    - interesting idea
  - annotation
    - word level
  - rectification module
    - no
  - feature map
    - 1d
  - decoder
    - RNN and attention
  - motivation
    - most existing methods directly encode a text image as a 1D sequence of features and then decode them to the predicted text, which implies that any text in an image is treated in the same direction such as from left to right by default. However, this is not true in the wild
  - solution & novelty
    - suggest that the visual representation of an arbitrarily oriented character in a 2D image can be described in four directions: lef t → right, right → lef t, top → bottom and bottom → top
  - the devil in the details
    - none
